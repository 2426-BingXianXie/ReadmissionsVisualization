    <h1>Hospital Readmission Trend</h1>
    <h3>Members: Mei Qi (Amy) Chen, Jenny Zhao, Tianyou Lyu, Eason Xie.</h3>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p><b style="color: darkblue;">An overall introduction to your project, including the topic and tasks.</b></p>
    <p>Hospital readmission rate is a concern for both healthcare providers and patients. In the majority
cases of readmissions, they not only signal potential lapses in patient care continuity but also
impose substantial financial burdens on providers and payers. In this project, we will use the
“Predicting Hospital Readmissions” dataset from Kaggle to visualize how readmission rates
change over time and across different patient groups. By transforming raw numbers into intuitive
charts, interactive dashboards, and spatial mappings, we aim to illuminate key patterns and
support stakeholders, clinicians, administrators, and policy makers, in identifying areas for
improvement and intervention.</p>

    <h2>Dataset Introduction:</h2>
    <p><b style="color: darkblue;">A paragraph to introduce the data, including the size, source and attributes.</b></p>
    <p>Our dataset “Predicting Hospital Readmissions” was retrieved from the public source Kaggle and
collected this data to analyze whether or not diabetes is a significant predictor of hospital
readmissions. This dataset contains 17 variables and approximately 25,000 rows of data which
will be cleaned and processed for missing rows and incomplete information.

    <h2>Visualization 6: Diagnosis Distribution by Age Group</h2>
    <div id="v6"></div>
    <p class='v'><b>Key Takeaway:</b> This grouped bar chart reveals how different 
        diagnoses are distributed across age groups. Circulatory conditions show the 
        highest frequency, particularly in the 70-80 age range, which aligns with 
        expected patterns of age-related cardiovascular issues. The visualization 
        allows for easy comparison of diagnosis patterns across the entire patient 
        population age spectrum.</p>

    <h2>Visualization 7: Medical Specialty Categories with Readmission Rates</h2>
    <div id="v7"></div>
    <p class='v'><b>Key Finding:</b> This horizontal bar chart identifies which 
        medical specialties face the greatest readmission challenges. Only specialties
        with 50+ patients are included to ensure statistical reliability, and missing 
        specialty data has been excluded. Specialties above the red average line have 
        elevated readmission rates, suggesting these departments may need targeted 
        interventions such as improved discharge education, enhanced follow-up care, 
        or better care coordination to reduce preventable readmissions.</p>
