    <h1>Hospital Readmission Trend</h1>
    <h3>Members: Mei Qi (Amy) Chen, Jenny Zhao, Tianyou Lyu, Eason Xie.</h3>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p><b style="color: darkblue;">An overall introduction to your project, including the topic and tasks.</b></p>
    <p>Hospital readmission rate is a concern for both healthcare providers and patients. In the majority
cases of readmissions, they not only signal potential lapses in patient care continuity but also
impose substantial financial burdens on providers and payers. In this project, we will use the
“Predicting Hospital Readmissions” dataset from Kaggle to visualize how readmission rates
change over time and across different patient groups. By transforming raw numbers into intuitive
charts, interactive dashboards, and spatial mappings, we aim to illuminate key patterns and
support stakeholders, clinicians, administrators, and policy makers, in identifying areas for
improvement and intervention.</p>

    <h2>Dataset Introduction:</h2>
    <p><b style="color: darkblue;">A paragraph to introduce the data, including the size, source and attributes.</b></p>
    <p>Our dataset “Predicting Hospital Readmissions” was retrieved from the public source Kaggle and
collected this data to analyze whether or not diabetes is a significant predictor of hospital
readmissions. This dataset contains 17 variables and approximately 25,000 rows of data which
will be cleaned and processed for missing rows and incomplete information.

    <h2>Visualization 1:</h2>

    <p class="v">
    <b>Key Finding:</b> 
    The full violin plot shows that most hospital-related measurements in the dataset are highly 
    right skewed, meaning the majority of patients use only a small amount of medical resources 
    while a smaller subset requires substantially more, with readmitted patients appearing more
    frequently in those higher-value ranges. 
    Because three of the variables (outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits) operate on a much 
    smaller scale and were visually compressed in the full plot, a separate log-scaled violin chart 
    was created, revealing more detailed variation and showing that patients with higher visit 
    frequency, especially before hospitalization, are more likely to be readmitted, suggesting prior 
    care utilization may be an early indicator of clinical instability.

    <p class='v'>
        <b>Key Finding:</b> 
        The ridgeline plot provides a high-level view of how each hospital utilization 
        metric is distributed across the patient population. Most features show a strong 
        right-skew, meaning that while the majority of patients use relatively few medical 
        resources, a smaller subset requires significantly more care. This suggests the presence 
        of a high-need patient group, which may be especially important when analyzing risk 
        factors for rehospitalization and designing targeted interventions.

    <p class = 'v'>
        <b>Key Finding:</b> 
        From the stacked bar chart, it can be seen that most values in this dataset for glucose 
        level is unavailable. However, through this stack bar chart's interactive selection 
        legend, it can be seen that in the dataset, most patients that readmit into hospitals 
        are patients in the age range of 70-80. This indicates that younger patients with diabeties 
        is less likely to be readmitted into hospitals whereas older patients are more likely to as
        seen from the right skew of both the high glucose level selection and the normal level selection.
        This also indicates that diabetes may not be an indication of hospital readmission since
        the distribution of high glucose count is about the same as the normal glucose count distribution.

    <h2>Visualization 4:</h2>
    <iframe src="multiLinear.html" width="600" height="400"></iframe>

    <p class = 'v'>
        <b>Key Finding:</b> 
        This multi-linear chart contains each line as different age groups, its X-axis as time in hospital (Days),
        and its Y-axis as the average number of procedures done for each age group for the amount of time they 
        stay in the hospial. The chart contains interactive elements including a selectable age range legend that will 
        allow users to see each line alone as well as a hover tooltip that will show age range, time in hospital, and average 
        procedures done of each data point. As the time in hospital increases, the amount of lab procedures done starts to gradually increase
        with patients in the age range of 90-100 having dramatic drops in the average number of procedure done. This may indicate
        patients in this age group typically leave the hospital after a certain time or they may have passed away. Moreover,
        starting on the first day, patients in age group 90-100 has a higher number of procedures done than any other groups. 
        Patients in the youngest age groupp 40-50 typically have fewer number of procedures done on average.

    <h2>Visualization 5: Diagnosis Distribution by Age Group</h2>
    <div id="v6"></div>
    <p class='v'>
    <p class='v'>
    <b>Key Finding:</b> This grouped bar chart reveals how different diagnoses are 
    distributed across age groups, with circulatory conditions showing the highest 
    frequency at nearly 2,400 cases in the 70-80 age range. The data demonstrates 
    clear age-related disease patterns, with both circulatory and respiratory conditions
    showing pronounced increases in elderly populations. Diabetes-related admissions 
    maintain relatively consistent levels across the 40-80 age range, indicating 
    sustained chronic disease burden across multiple decades. Younger patients (under 50) 
    represent a smaller proportion of admissions across all categories, while the 70-80 
    age bracket accounts for the overwhelming majority of hospital utilization. 
    These patterns suggest healthcare systems should prioritize geriatric medicine 
    resources and implement preventive care interventions for patients in their 60s 
    before they enter the highest-risk age group.
</p>

    <h2>Visualization 6: Medical Specialty Categories with Readmission Rates</h2>
    <div id="v7"></div>
    <p class='v'>
    <b>Key Finding:</b> This horizontal bar chart identifies medical specialties with 
    the greatest readmission challenges, showing Family/General Practice and 
    Emergency/Trauma departments with rates approaching 50%, substantially above 
    the hospital average of 47%. Cardiology and Internal Medicine demonstrate 
    readmission rates at or slightly below average despite treating complex chronic 
    conditions, suggesting more robust discharge protocols. Surgery and "Other" 
    specialties show the lowest rates at approximately 41-42%, indicating benefits 
    from standardized recovery protocols and clearer post-operative instructions. 
    The 10-percentage-point variation between highest and lowest performing specialties 
    represents significant opportunities for quality improvement through knowledge 
    transfer. Specialties above the average line should prioritize interventions 
    including dedicated care coordinators, enhanced patient education, and structured 
    follow-up systems to reduce preventable readmissions.

                style="border: none;"
            ></iframe>
        </div>
    <p class='v'><b>Key Finding:</b> This parallel coordinates chart shows clear differences 
        between patients who were readmitted and those who were not. Patients who were readmitted 
        tend to have higher values across multiple measures, especially the number 
        of medications and lab procedures. Their lines appear more concentrated in 
        the upper ranges of the plot. This suggests that patients with more complex 
        medical needs or heavier treatment plans are more likely to return to the hospital. 
        In contrast, non-readmitted patients show lower and more stable values across most attributes. 
        Overall, the chart highlights a strong link between treatment intensity and readmission risk.

    <h2>Visualization 8: Readmission Rate Heatmap</h2>

                style="border: none;"
            ></iframe>
        </div>
    <p class='v'><b>Key Finding:</b> This heatmap shows that readmission rates vary strongly across both diagnosis types and medical specialties. 
        Some combinations stand out with higher rates, such as diabetes cases treated in cardiology or emergency departments. 
        These areas appear in darker green. This suggests that certain patient groups may require closer follow-up or more targeted discharge planning. 
        In contrast, specialties like surgery or family practice show lower readmission rates for many diagnoses. Overall, the heatmap highlights where readmission 
        risk is concentrated and helps identify which diagnosis specialty pairs may benefit from additional support.</p>
